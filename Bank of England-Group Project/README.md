 Project Overview
The Bank of England (BoE) communicates its monetary and economic views through public speeches. These speeches can influence markets, set expectations, and shape economic sentiment. However, the extent to which speech sentiment reflects or predicts economic outcomes remains uncertain.

In this project, our team aimed to analyze the sentiment of BoE speeches over time and assess their relationship with key UK economic indicators. We explored whether sentiment shifts could act as signals for changes in economic conditions or market responses.

Business Questions
Has BoE speech sentiment changed over time?

How do speech sentiments correspond with major economic events like interest rate decisions?

Are there measurable correlations between sentiment and UK economic indicators (e.g. inflation, GDP, bond yields)?

Is speech sentiment predictive of market behavior, or reactive to existing economic trends?
