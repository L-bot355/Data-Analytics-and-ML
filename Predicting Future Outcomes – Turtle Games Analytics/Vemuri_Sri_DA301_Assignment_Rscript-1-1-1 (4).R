# Exploratory Data Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression for Predicting Loyalty Points for Turtle Games

# The objective of this analysis is to assist Turtle Games' sales department, who prefer R for their sales analyses, by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modeling. Using R.

# Approach:

# I will analyse customer data, focusing on predicting loyalty points based on available features through a multiple linear regression model. This analysis will provide insights for refining the loyalty program, and I'll offer recommendations on model suitability, potential improvements to the program, and alternative solutions.

# Firstly, I will import the required libraries for statistical analysis.

# Key insights:

# Income is fairly symmetric around £48k, with moderate variability.

# Spending Score is perfectly centered around 50, indicating an evenly spread score distribution.

# Loyalty Points show high variability (std. dev is approximately 1283), suggesting some customers are significantly more loyal or engaged than others.

# Insights:

# Skewness: 0.41 → Slight right skew, indicating a few customers earn significantly more than average.

# Kurtosis: 2.59 → Close to normal distribution but with slightly heavier tails, meaning there are more outliers than a perfect bell curve.

# Spending Score:

# Skewness: -0.04 → Nearly symmetric, indicating balanced spending across customers.

# Kurtosis: 2.11 → Close to normal distribution, indicating no extreme outliers.

# Recommendation

# Turtle Games should be mindful of the high-income outliers when segmenting customers for targeted campaigns, while the balanced spending scores suggest consistent behaviour across most customers.

# Display the correlation matrix
print(cor_matrix)

# Key insights:

# Values close to 1: Strong positive correlation.
# Values close to -1: Strong negative correlation.
# Values near 0: No significant correlation.

# Income & Loyalty Points: Moderately positive correlation (0.62) — higher earners tend to have more loyalty points.

# Spending Score & Loyalty Points: Also moderately positive (0.67) — more engaged spenders earn more points.

# Income & Spending Score: Very weak correlation (0.006) — income doesn't directly predict spending behavior in this dataset.

# Recommendations:

# I recommend Turtle Games target higher earners (income & loyalty points: 0.62) and more engaged spenders (spending score & loyalty points: 0.67) for tailored loyalty programs. Income has no significant impact on spending (0.006), so it should not be a primary factor in engagement strategies.

# Key insights of the scatter plot.

# This scatter plot displays the relationship between income and spending score, differentiated by gender (blue for gender 0, pink for gender 1) and loyalty points (represented by dot size). 
# The nearly horizontal regression lines for both genders suggest minimal correlation between income and spending behavior. 
# There's high variability in spending scores across all income levels, indicating that income alone doesn't predict spending patterns well. 
# Both genders show similar trends, and loyalty points appear distributed across various income and spending combinations without a clear pattern.

# Creating a scatter plot of Income vs Loyalty Points helps visually identify any potential relationship or pattern between these two variables. 
# It provides an intuitive understanding of how income might influence or correlate with loyalty points, guiding further analysis.

# Recommendations:

# Income shows minimal correlation with spending behaviour (correlation near 0), with high variability in spending scores across all income levels. 
# Loyalty points are distributed across various income and spending combinations, suggesting that Turtle Games should focus on alternative 
# customer segmentation strategies beyond income to enhance targeted marketing and loyalty programs.

# Key insights:

# This box plot displays income distribution with outlier detection. 
# The main income data ranges from approximately 15 to 65 (represented by the blue box), with the median around 45 (horizontal line within the box). 
# One significant outlier is labeled "Potential Outlier" in red at the top of the chart, with a value around 110-120. 
# Individual data points are overlaid and colour-coded by gender (pink for gender 0, blue for gender 1), showing a relatively even distribution of both genders across income levels. 
# The distribution appears somewhat normal within the main range, with most data concentrated in the middle and fewer observations at the extremes, except for the identified outlier.

# Recommendations:

# Income ranges from 15 to 65, with a median around 45. A potential outlier is detected between 110-120. 
# Most customers fall within the main range, with an even gender distribution. Marketing strategies should target the core income range, excluding the outlier, and remain gender-neutral.

# Converting Education, a categorical variable as a factor, this tells R that these are categories and not quantities, to obtain count by category.

# Income distributin across education levels using Ridge plot

A ridge plot helps visualise the distribution of a continuous variable (like income) across different categories (e.g., education levels) in a compact and comparative way.

#Justification

# The chart helps identify how income varies by education level, supporting targeted promotions and product pricing strategies. 
# It refines customer personas for tailored campaigns and upselling. 
# When combined with location data, it guides regional sales planning and potential partnership opportunities.

# Key insights:

# This ridge plot shows income distribution across five different education levels (0-4). Each colored layer represents a different education level, with income displayed on the x-axis (0-100).
# Key observations:

# Education level 0 (purple, bottom layer) shows a bimodal distribution with peaks around 30 and 75, suggesting two distinct income groups at this education level.

# Education level 1 (blue) has its highest concentration around 50, with a wider spread extending to higher incomes.

# Education level 2 (teal) shows a main peak around 45-50 with a secondary bump around 75.

# Education level 3 (green) displays a more uniform distribution centered around 50-60.

# Education level 4 (yellow, top layer) shows the highest overall distribution centered around 50-70.

# Generally, there appears to be a trend where higher education levels (especially 3 and 4) have more concentrated distributions at middle to higher income ranges, 
# while lower education levels show more variability and sometimes bimodal patterns. 
# However, all education levels still show substantial overlap in their income distributions, indicating that education is not the sole determinant of income in this dataset.

# Recommendations for Turtle Games:

# data shows that income generally increases with education level. 
# Since income strongly influences spending behaviour, Turtle Games to target customers with higher education levels for our premium board games and using educationally themed marketing campaigns.

# Key insights:

This is a correlation matrix plot showing relationships between five variables: income, loyalty points, spending score, age, and gender (coded as 0 and 1, shown in red and teal respectively).

# Key relationships:

# Income and loyalty points have a strong positive correlation (0.616***), with gender group 0 showing a slightly stronger relationship (0.675***) than gender group 1 (0.549***).

# Loyalty points and spending score also have a strong positive correlation (0.672***), stronger for gender group 1 (0.701***) than group 0 (0.646***).

# Spending score and age show a significant negative correlation (-0.224***), meaning younger customers tend to have higher spending scores.

# Income shows almost no correlation with spending score (0.006) or age (-0.006).

# Age has minimal correlation with income or loyalty points.

# The diagonal shows distributions of each variable:

# Income has a multimodal distribution with most values between 20-60.

# Loyalty points are heavily concentrated at lower values with a long right tail.

# Spending score shows a multimodal distribution across the 0-100 range.

# Age is normally distributed with most customers between 30-50.

# Gender shows an approximately even split between categories 0 and 1.

# Scatter plots between variables illustrate these relationships visually, with box plots on the right showing similar distributions of each variable across gender groups, though with some subtle differences in loyalty points and spending patterns.

# Recommendations:

# Target high-income customers: Income and loyalty points have a 0.616 correlation, indicating higher income leads to more loyalty points.

# Segment by gender: Gender group 0 shows a stronger correlation of 0.675 between income and loyalty points.

# Engage younger customers: Age has a negative correlation of -0.224 with spending score, suggesting younger customers spend more.

# Enhance loyalty program: A 0.672 correlation between loyalty points and spending score highlights the importance of rewarding high spenders.

# Key insights:

# The key findings show that loyalty points have a high mean (1578) with significant variation (1283), indicating diverse engagement. 
# Income averages 48.08 with a large spread (23.12), reflecting varying customer income levels. Spending score centers around 50 with moderate variation (26.09), 
# suggesting different spending behaviors, recommending targeted strategies based on income and loyalty engagement.

# Recommendations

# Based on the key findings I recommend Turtle Games implement segmented marketing strategies based on customer income and loyalty engagement. 
# With high variability in loyalty points (mean 1578, sd 1283) and income (mean 48.08, sd 23.12), 
# Turtle Games should tailor promotions for high-income, loyal customers while addressing diverse spending behaviors with personalized offers or loyalty rewards. 
# Understanding these customer segments can optimize marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and drive sales growth.

# Determine the features of multilinear regression

# Determining the features for multilinear regression helps identify the most influential variables that affect the dependent variable. 
# By selecting relevant features, you ensure a more accurate and reliable predictive model. 
# This step is crucial for Turtle Games to make data-driven decisions, such as optimising marketing strategies or forecasting sales.

# Assessing Relationships Between Loyalty Points, Income, and Spending Score".

# Calculating the correlation helps identify relationships between loyalty points, income, and spending score to select relevant predictors for multilinear regression. This ensures features are appropriately correlated and not highly collinear, avoiding skewed results.

cor(data[, c("loyalty_points", "income", "spending_score")])

# The results show a moderate positive correlation (0.62) between loyalty points and income, and a strong positive correlation (0.67) between loyalty points and spending score. 
# Income and spending score have almost no correlation (0.01). These insights suggest that loyalty points and spending are strongly linked, while income doesn't directly influence spending behaviour.

# Recommendation

# Turtle Games should focus on rewarding customers who accumulate loyalty points, as they also tend to have higher spending scores. 
# Given the weak relationship between income and spending, strategies should target customer engagement through loyalty programs rather than income-based segmentation. 
# Tailoring offers to those with higher loyalty points could enhance customer retention and spending.

# The next step is to build a linear regression model to understand how income and spending_score influence loyalty_points. 
# By fitting this model, I can identify which variables have a significant impact on loyalty points and quantify the relationships. 
# Checking the data structure (str(data)) and previewing the data (head(data)) ensures that the dataset is correctly formatted and ready for model training.

# The variables include categorical features like gender and education, numerical features like income, spending_score, and loyalty_points, and text data like review and summary. 
# This provides an overview of the data types and their distributions, helping in further analysis and model building.

# Linear Regression Analysis: Impact of Income and Spending Score on Loyalty Points

# The model will show which factors are most important for customer engagement.

model <- lm(loyalty_points ~ income + spending_score, data = data)
summary(model)

# Interpretation of Model Summary

# Coefficients:- Intercept: When income and spending_score are 0, the predicted value of loyalty_points is -1700. This suggests the intercept is less meaningful in this context since neither income nor spending score are likely to be 0.

# Income: For each unit increase in income. loyalty_points increase by 33.98, This is a strong positive association.

# Spending score: For each unit increase in spending_score, loyalty_points increase by 32.98- also strongly positive.

# Significance:

# Both predictors income and spending_score,are highly significant(p-values<0.001)

# Goodness of the fit

# R-Squared: 0.8269, indicates that 82.69 of the variation in loyalty_points,is explained by the model,which is a very good fit.

# Residual standard error: 534.1, shows the average deviation of observed values from the fitted regression line.

# F-statistic: The very high F-value(4770) and p value(p-value: < 2.2e-16) confirm that the model is statistically significant.

# Recommendations for Turtle Games:

# Leverage Income and Spending Score: Every unit increase in income (33.98) and spending score (32.98) significantly boosts loyalty points. 
# Target high-income and high-spending customers with tailored promotions.

# Enhance Loyalty Program: With an R-squared of 0.8269, 82.69% of loyalty points variation is explained by income and spending. 
# Introduce tiered loyalty rewards based on these factors to maximize engagement.

# Data-Driven Segmentation: 
# Both predictors (income and spending score) are highly significant (p-value < 0.001), suggesting targeted marketing and rewards for these key customer segments will drive loyalty.

# Visualise the model

# Plot the actuals vs predicted values to assess model accuracy.

# Visualising actual vs. predicted values helps assess model accuracy by comparing real outcomes to predictions. 
# It identifies areas of over or under-prediction and checks for random distribution of residuals. 
# This step ensures the model fits well and validates its assumptions.

# Explanation of the chart:

# This scatter plot shows the relationship between predicted and actual loyalty points. Here's a summary:

# The y-axis represents "Actual Values" (ranging from approximately 0 to 6000)

# Blue dots represent individual data points

# A red diagonal line shows the trend/regression line#

# Key insights:

# There's a strong positive correlation between predicted and actual values

# The model appears to underestimate higher loyalty point values (many points above the red line in the upper range)

# Data points are more concentrated in the lower to middle range

# The spread of points increases at higher values, suggesting more variability in predictions for high-value customers

# The model appears reasonably accurate overall but shows some systematic bias at the extremes

# Recommendations:

# Based on the findings, Turtle Games should focus on refining the model's predictions for high-loyalty customers, as the model underestimates their loyalty points. 
# While the model is generally accurate, there's variability at higher values that could be addressed for better targeting of high-value customers. 
# Improved predictions could enhance personalised marketing and customer engagement strategies for these segments.

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model)

# Explanation of the chart:

# The above shows four diagnostic plots for a regression model:
  
# Residuals vs Fitted (top left): Shows a curved pattern rather than random scatter, suggesting non-linear relationships aren't captured by the model. 
# The residuals range from about -2000 to 2000, with larger residuals at both low and high fitted values.

# Q-Q Residuals (top right): Compares standardized residuals to theoretical quantiles. 
# The s-shaped curve indicates non-normally distributed residuals, with heavier tails than a normal distribution.

# Scale-Location (bottom left): Shows the square root of standardized residuals vs fitted values. 
# The curved pattern confirms heteroscedasticity - the variance of residuals changes across fitted values.

# Residuals vs Leverage (bottom right): Identifies influential points. Several observations are labeled (1872, 1887, 1706) as potential outliers, with Cook's distance contours shown.

# Overall, these plots indicate model issues: non-linearity, non-normal errors, heteroscedasticity, and potentially influential outliers. 
# The regression assumptions aren't fully met, suggesting the model could be improved through transformations or alternative modeling approaches.

# Recommendations

# I recommend Turtle Games to consider revising the model by applying transformations to address non-linearity and heteroscedasticity. 
# Additionally, exploring alternative modeling techniques or removing influential outliers could improve predictive accuracy and model reliability.


# Scenario-based predictions:

# Scenario-based predictions help Turtle Games estimate loyalty points for different customer profiles, guiding targeted marketing and resource allocation strategies. 
# This allows the company to assess the impact of income or spending behaviour changes on customer engagement.

# use the model to predict loyalty points for hypothetical customers

new_data <- data.frame(income = c(50000, 80000), spending_score = c(60, 90))

# Explanation of the predictions:

# The predictions indicate that for a customer with an income of £50,000 and a spending score of 60, the predicted loyalty points would be 1,684,215, while for a customer with an income of £80,000 and a spending score of 90, the predicted loyalty points would be 2,695,578. 
# These predictions help Turtle Games identify potential customer loyalty based on varying income and spending behaviors, guiding targeted marketing strategies.

# Recommendations about the hypothetical predictions:

# The model predicts loyalty points of 1,684,215 for a customer with an income of £50,000 and spending score of 60, and 2,695,578 for a customer with an income of £80,000 and spending score of 90. 
# These values seem unreasonably high, suggesting the model needs refinement through variable transformation or different techniques to ensure accurate, realistic predictions.

# Adjusted R-Squared:

# checking the Adjusted R-Squared is crucial for Turtle Games. It refines the model's accuracy by adjusting for the number of predictors, ensuring the model's improvements aren't just due to overfitting, which helps make more reliable predictions for customer loyalty.

# Fit the linear model

# Key insights:

# The regression model explains 82.69% of the variance in loyalty points (R-squared = 0.8269), with both income and spending score being significant predictors (p-values < 2e-16). 
# Income increases loyalty points by 33.98 per unit, while spending score increases loyalty points by 32.89 per unit. 
# The model's Residual Standard Error of 534.1 shows a relatively small average prediction error, making it a reliable tool for predicting loyalty points.

# Model performance insights

# The Adjusted R-squared (0.8267) being very close to the R-squared (0.8269) indicates that the model is well-generalized and does not suffer from overfitting. 
# This suggests that the inclusion of the predictors, income and spending score, is appropriate, and the model is likely to perform well on new, unseen data, making it reliable for predicting loyalty points in different scenarios.


# Since the adjusted R-squared is very close to R-squared (0.8269), the model generalises well to the data.

# Analysing the Adjusted R - squared as against the hypothetical prediction:

# The recommendation to refine the model is based on the fact that the predicted loyalty points (1,684,215 and 2,695,578) are excessively high and unrealistic. 
# While the Adjusted R-squared shows that the model fits the data well, the actual predictions suggest that the model does not always yield reasonable outcomes, especially at the extremes. 
# This discrepancy points to the need for adjustments, such as transforming the variables or exploring alternative modeling techniques, to ensure the model provides more realistic and actionable predictions for Turtle Games.

# Data transformation

# Data transformation is used to address skewness, outliers, and improve model accuracy for more reliable predictions.

data$log_income <- log(data$income + 1)  # log transformation with a small constant to avoid log(0)
data$log_spending_score <- log(data$spending_score + 1)
data$log_loyalty_points <- log(data$loyalty_points + 1)

# To verify the transformation

# Apply log transformations with a small constant added
data$log_income <- log(data$income + 1)
data$log_spending_score <- log(data$spending_score + 1)
data$log_loyalty_points <- log(data$loyalty_points + 1)

# Print the first few rows to check the transformations
head(data[, c("log_income", "log_spending_score", "log_loyalty_points")])

# In the next step I would like to check the model based on the Transformation

# checking the model post-transformation to confirm if it addresses previous issues like unreasonable predictions, and to ensure it better fits the data. 
# This step is crucial for verifying whether the transformation leads to a more realistic model, enabling Turtle Games to make better decisions based on accurate predictions.

# fitting a new regression model using the transformed variables:

model_transformed <- lm(log_loyalty_points ~ log_income + log_spending_score, data = data)
summary(model_transformed)

# Key insights and model overview:

# The regression model now uses the log-transformed variables (log_loyalty_points, log_income, log_spending_score), and the results show a much improved fit compared to the previous model.

# Significant Coefficients:

# Intercept: -0.933642, which represents the baseline when both log-income and log-spending score are zero (this is more of a mathematical construct rather than a meaningful figure).

# log_income: For each unit increase in log-transformed income, the loyalty points increase by approximately 1.067. The p-value (< 2e-16) shows a very strong significance.

# log_spending_score: Similarly, for each unit increase in log-transformed spending score, the loyalty points increase by about 1.049, also highly significant with a p-value of (< 2e-16).

# Model Fit:

# R-squared: 0.9791, meaning that 97.91% of the variation in log_loyalty_points is explained by log_income and log_spending_score. 
# This is an excellent fit, showing that the transformed model explains almost all the variability in the data.

# Adjusted R-squared: 0.979, which is very close to R-squared, confirming that the model generalizes well to the data.

# Residual standard error: 0.1473, indicating a low average deviation between the observed and predicted values.

# F-statistic: 46,670 with a p-value < 2.2e-16, confirming the overall statistical significance of the model.

# Residuals:

# The residuals show a relatively small spread (Min: -0.533, Max: 0.186), indicating that the model predictions are close to the actual values, which suggests a good model fit.


# Recommendations for Turtle Games:

# Refined Predictions: The log-transformed model provides more accurate loyalty point predictions, with a strong fit (R-squared: 0.979).

# Targeting High-Value Customers: The model helps identify high-income and high-spending customers, enabling more precise loyalty point predictions.

# Strategic Insights: Utilize this model to improve customer segmentation, targeted promotions, and loyalty behavior predictions.

# Conclusion: 

# The log-transformed model significantly improves prediction accuracy (R-squared: 0.979), addressing previous issues like unreasonable predictions. 
# It enables Turtle Games to more precisely target high-income, high-spending customers for better loyalty point predictions and refined customer segmentation. 
# This reliable model offers valuable insights for marketing strategies, enhancing data-driven decision-making and supporting targeted promotions and sales efforts.
